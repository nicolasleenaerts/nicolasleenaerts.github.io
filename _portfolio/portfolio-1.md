title: "NLML"
excerpt: "NLML is a github repository containing scripts which make performing methodologically correct machine learning analyses more easy. The scripts in this repository were initially developed to build person-specific and pooled prediction models for binge eating, binge drinking and alcohol use with ecological momentary assessment data. However, they can be used in all kinds of contexts."
