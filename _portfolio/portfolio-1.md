NLML is a Github repository containing scripts that make performing methodologically correct machine learning analyses easier. The scripts in this repository were initially developed to build person-specific and pooled prediction models for binge eating, binge drinking and alcohol use with ecological momentary assessment data. However, they can be used in all kinds of contexts.
