excerpt: 'This study investigates the relation between stress-induced DA release in the vmPFC, fronto-striatal connectivity, and NU in daily life. Its result suggest that stress can differentially impact FC between the vmPFC and striatum, leading to a lower FC with the dorsal striatum and a higher FC with the contralateral ventral striatum. Furthermore, individuals with a higher FC between the vmPFC and dorsal striatum displayed more NU in daily life. Contrary to our hypotheses, individuals with a higher stress-induced DA release in the vmPFC also had a higher stress-induced change in fronto-striatal FC and displayed more NU in daily life. '
