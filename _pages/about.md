> **Note:** Currently looking for partners to organise a self-funded postdoc on the use of machine learning and reinforcement learning in JITAIs

# Who is Nicolas Leenaerts?

Well, that's me! A psychiatry resident at both Zorggroep Sint-Kamillus and the penitentiary of Merksplas in Belgium. Additionally, I'm training in cognitive behavioral therapy and doing research at the KU Leuven.

## What is Belgium?
Belgium is a country nestled in the heart of Western Europe. It's not only my home, but also the place where I went to university and where I currently work.

## What is the KU Leuven?

The KU Leuven is a 600-year old university in Belgium with famous alumni such as Erasmus and Vesalius. I attended the KU Leuven to study medicine. Afterwards, I started my psychiatry residency and earned my PhD in Biomedical Sciences under the guidance of Professor Elske Vrieze. My doctoral research focused on investigating the relation between stress, negative affect, and binge behavior with the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). I bundled my research findings in a thesis titled 'Spinning Out Of Control: How Stress And Negative Affect Lead To Binge Behavior In Bulimia Nervosa And Alcohol Use Disorder.'

## So what are my current research interests?

During my PhD, I became more and more interested in all things related to machine learning. Specifically, I am passionate about the development of prediction models for a Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI). In a JITAI, interventions are delivered in real-time when patients need them the most, and I am convinced that they will be a breakthrough in the history of psychotherapy. With the help of Peter Soyster (UC Berkeley) and prof. Aaron Fisher (UC Berkeley), I have built pooled and person-specific prediction models for daily life eating and alcohol use behavior in patients with bulimia nervosa or alcohol use disorder. In a collaboration with prof. Kelsey Hagan (Virginia Commonwealth University) and prof. Lisa Ranzenhofer (Columbia University), I have developed pooled and person-specific prediction models for daily life loss-of-control eating and overeating in adolescents. You can find the preprints of this work on PsyArXiv by clicking the link in the sidebar on the left. Together with researchers of the KU Leuven, I have built prediction models for the survival of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and for the motor function of patients with cerebral palsy. I hope to come out with this work in the coming months.

Beyond the practical application of machine learning, I'm invested in advancing methodological knowledge within the field. With the help of prof. Maarten Van Smeden (UMC Utrecht), I am working on a simulation study to evaluate different multiple imputation strategies in penalized regression prediction models.  Furthermore, I am a strong believer in sharing tools with other researchers. Therefore, there are several github repositories that on the 'Projects' page  that allow researchers to build methodologically correct prediction models.

Looking ahead, I'm eager to broaden my expertise in reinforcement learning. To do so, I'm seeking partnerships for a self-funded postdoctoral project focused on the integration of reinforcement learning within the realm of JITAIs.

Throughout my PhD journey, my fascination with machine learning has grown steadily. Particularly, my passion lies in crafting prediction models tailored for Just-In-Time Adaptive Interventions (JITAIs). JITAIs offer real-time interventions precisely when individuals need them most, marking what I believe will be a significant breakthrough in psychotherapy. Collaborating with esteemed academics like Peter Soyster and Professor Aaron Fisher from UC Berkeley, I've delved into constructing both pooled and person-specific prediction models. These models focus on daily life behaviors such as eating and alcohol consumption among patients with bulimia nervosa or alcohol use disorder. Additionally, alongside Professor Kelsey Hagan from Virginia Commonwealth University and Professor Lisa Ranzenhofer from Columbia University, I've extended this work to adolescents, developing prediction models for loss-of-control eating and overeating.

Moreover, in partnership with researchers from KU Leuven, I've contributed to building prediction models for patient survival in conditions like amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and assessing motor function in cerebral palsy patients. These projects are nearing completion, and I anticipate publishing our findings in the coming months.

Beyond the practical application of machine learning, I'm deeply invested in advancing methodological knowledge within the field. Teaming up with Professor Maarten Van Smeden from UMC Utrecht, I'm currently engaged in a simulation study to assess various multiple imputation strategies in penalized regression prediction models. Furthermore, I advocate for open science principles and have developed several GitHub repositories aimed at facilitating the construction of methodologically sound prediction models for fellow researchers.
