 Currently looking for partners to organise a self-funded postdoc on the use of machine learning and reinforcement learning for JITAIs

## Who is Nicolas Leenaerts

Well, that's me! A psychiatry resident at both Zorggroep Sint-Kamillus and the penitentiary of Merksplas in Belgium. Additionally, I'm training in cognitive behavioral therapy, and I'm engaged in research at the KU Leuven.

## What is Belgium?
Belgium is a country nestled in the heart of Western Europe. It's not only my home, but also the place where I went to university and where I currently work.

Specifically, I attended the KU Leuven to study medicine. Afterwards, I started my psychiatry residency and earned my PhD in Biomedical Sciences under the guidance of Professor Elske Vrieze. My doctoral research focused on investigating the relation between stress, negative affect, and binge behavior with the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). I bundled my research findings in a thesis titled 'Spinning Out Of Control: How Stress And Negative Affect Lead To Binge Behavior In Bulimia Nervosa And Alcohol Use Disorder.'

## So what are your current research interests?

During my PhD, I became more and more interested in all things related to machine learning. Specifically, I am passionate about the development of prediction models for a Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI). In a JITAI, interventions are delivered in  real-time when patients need them the most, and I am convinced that they will be a breakthrough in the history of psychotherapy.
