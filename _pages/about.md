# Who is Nicolas Leenaerts?

Well, that's me! A psychiatry resident at both Zorggroep Sint-Kamillus and the penitentiary of Merksplas in Belgium. Additionally, I'm training in cognitive behavioral therapy and doing research at the KU Leuven.

## What is Belgium?
Belgium is a country nestled in the heart of Western Europe. It's not only my home, but also the place where I went to university and where I currently work.

The KU Leuven is a 600-year old university in Belgium with famous alumni such as Erasmus and Vesalius. I attended the KU Leuven to study medicine. Afterwards, I started my psychiatry residency and earned my PhD in Biomedical Sciences under the guidance of Professor Elske Vrieze. My doctoral research focused on investigating the relation between stress, negative affect, and binge behavior with the Experience Sampling Method (ESM), Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI), and Positron Emission Tomography (PET). I bundled my research findings in a thesis titled 'Spinning Out Of Control: How Stress And Negative Affect Lead To Binge Behavior In Bulimia Nervosa And Alcohol Use Disorder.'

## So what are my current research interests?

During my PhD, I became more and more interested in all things related to machine learning. Specifically, I am passionate about the development of prediction models for a Just-In-Time Adaptive Intervention (JITAI). In a JITAI, interventions are delivered in real-time when patients need them the most, and I am convinced that they will be a breakthrough in the history of psychotherapy.

I have developed pooled and person-specific prediction models for daily life eating and alcohol use behavior in people with and without a psychiatric disorder. You can find the preprints of this work on PsyArXiv by clicking the link in the sidebar on the left. Additionally, I have built prediction models for the survival of patients with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and for the motor function of patients with cerebral palsy. I hope to come out with this work in the coming months.
